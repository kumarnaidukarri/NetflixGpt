Firebase :-
Firebase is a google platform which gives services.
it provides services like Firebase Hosting, Backend Servers, Authentication Login system, Firebase Database, Cloud storage, Cloud functions messaging tools
  
1) Firebase Developers Console Setup:-
 go to firebase.google.com and create an user account.
 i) create a project app.
 ii) select 'add app' and 'Web'.
 Authentication
 iii) select 'Register app' and 'Firebase Hosting setup'.  
      follow instructions, copy those "SDK config data".
      that 'SDK config data' is needed to connect our "React App" to this 'Firebase App Server'.
      copy paste this 'SDK config data' into our app. (create a firebase.js file with this config data in our local project).
      next -> next -> done
 iv) Enable Authentication:
     build -> authentication -> get started
     enable required login types: email password, phone, google login, FB login, twitter login etc.
     Now, the customers whoever uses our React App's Signin or Signup Form.
     they can be seen in Firebase Users Dashboard.

2) Hosting our Project using Firebase:-  
   Steps:
   1) first create/register a project in 'Firebase Developer Console'.
   2) copy paste the 'SDK config data' into our app. when registering your app in 'Firebase Developer Console' you get this 'SDK config data'. 
      (create a firebase.js file in our local project and paste this 'SDK config data').
   3) commands:
      -> npm install firebase  
      -> npm install -g firebase-tools
      -> firebase --version
      -> firebase login
         it connects to your Firebase developer account and gives access to projects.

   2 Types of Deploys:-
     1. Local manually deploy our App to Firebase:- 
         i)Config setup:
           it creates "firebase.json" and ".firebaserc" config files in our project after doing below setup steps. 
           command: 
            firebase init
           select options:
            - Hosting: Set up deployments for static web apps
            - use an Existing Project (netflixgpt)
            - public directory:
              choose folder 'dist'(if Parcel or Vite), 'build'(if CreateReactApp)    
            - configure as singe-page-app rewrite all urls as index.html: "NO"
            - setup auto build deploys for GITHUB: "NO"
         ii)Hosting setup:
            npm run build    - generates optimized code in a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
            firebase deploy  - deploys our app and gives deployed live URL.
                               it uploads project files from 'dist' folder to "Firebase Hosting servers (CDN)".
            note: when we update our Project code. follow these 2 commands for "Re-Deployment".

     2. Github Actions:-
         connect github project repo to firebase for auto-deployment.  

3) Shortcut easy steps to Deploy/Host your app in Firebase :-
 1)create a project in 'Firebase Developer Console'. copy and save 'SDK config data' safely.
 2)create a 'firebase.js' file in our local project and paste this 'SDK config data' here.
 3)commands:
   -> npm install firebase  
   -> npm install -g firebase-tools
   -> firebase --version
   -> firebase login
      it connects to your Firebase developer account and gives access to projects.
 4)setup configuration in local project.
   command: 
    firebase init 
   select options:
    -> Hosting: Set up deployments for static web apps
    -> use an Existing Project (netflixgpt) 
    -> public directory: folder 'dist' (if Vite)
    -> configure as singe-page-app rewrite all urls as index.html: "NO"
    -> setup auto build deploys for GITHUB: "NO"
   it creates "firebase.json" and ".firebaserc" config files in our project after doing above setup steps.  
  5)Hosting run:
    npm run build    - generates optimized code in a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
    firebase deploy  - deploys our app and gives deployed live URL.
                       it uploads project files from 'dist' folder to "Firebase Hosting servers (CDN)".
    note: when we update our Project code. follow these 2 commands for "Re-Deployment".
